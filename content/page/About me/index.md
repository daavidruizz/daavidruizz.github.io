# Hi, I'm David Ruiz

**Passionate about Linux, C, firmware development, and continuously learning new technologies.**

Computer Engineer graduated from the University of Málaga (2024). I have solid experience in programming, with a strong focus on languages like C and C++, which I have worked with consistently throughout my studies and in my current professional role. Additionally, I am proficient in other languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.

I am highly familiar with Linux/Unix systems and Bash scripting, and I have a strong interest in embedded systems development, firmware design, and IoT solutions. I have hands-on experience with TCP-based protocols like MQTT and have worked with FreeRTOS, along with other platforms and technologies such as Apache, MySQL, and Android development.

Beyond my technical expertise, I am a highly sociable and collaborative individual who thrives in team environments and enjoys tackling complex challenges through innovative solutions.

**Currently exploring**: Advanced embedded systems, open-source contributions, and emerging IoT technologies.
